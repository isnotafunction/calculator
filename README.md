## [JavaScript calculator](https://isnotafunction.github.io/calculator/)

This project is a part of pre-course material for Founders and Coders.

Fulfilled user stories:  
* I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

* I can clear the input field with a clear button.

* I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
